          <p>Happy 6 years, my boo.</p>
          <p>I love you so much, and it aches my heart to celebrate another year without you by my side. These photos are just a glimpse of all the moments, emotions, and memories I’ve shared with you.</p>
          <p>You always ask how I still stick around even when you trouble me so much — it’s because of this. It’s because of us. It’s these moments that I love with you. I can’t be this comfortable, this full of emotion and liveliness, with anyone else.</p>
          <p>We’ve grown together, and I’m so grateful that you’re such an integral part of my growing-up story. Six years have passed, and I can’t wait to spend a lifetime more with you. But we’ll get to that later — for now, I’m just happy to be your love for the past six years.</p>
          <p>We’ve been through so many ups and downs, yet I’m glad we always found our way back to each other. I’m glad we both stayed strong and kept fighting for us — even in moments when many wouldn’t have.</p>
          <p>I’m so deeply in love with you, and every time I see you, I fall for you all over again. 💛</p>
